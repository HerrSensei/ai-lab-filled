  "description": "Refactor the AI service layer to support multiple AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) through a provider-agnostic interface. This involves defining an abstract AI service interface, implementing concrete adapters for each provider, and configuring the application to use the desired provider via dependency injection.",
