# {{ project_name }} - AI/ML Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is an AI/ML project focused on `{{ description }}`. It leverages machine learning models and data processing to achieve its goals.

## 🤖 AI/ML Stack
*   **Frameworks**: Python, `{{ framework }}`
*   **Libraries**: `{{ ai_stack }}`
*   **Model Serving**: Ollama (planned/integrated)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Setup Environment**:
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    poetry install
    # Or pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Data Preparation**:
    *   Place your raw data in `data/raw/`.
    *   Run data preprocessing scripts (if any) in `scripts/data/`.
3.  **Model Training**:
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```
4.  **Model Evaluation**:
    *   Run evaluation scripts in `src/`.
5.  **Ollama Integration**:
    *   Ensure Ollama is running.
    *   Follow instructions in `docs/ollama_integration.md` (if available) to integrate your model.

## 📁 Project Structure
*   `src/`: Source code for models, training, and inference.
*   `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
*   `models/`: Trained model checkpoints and configurations.
*   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
*   `prompts/`: AI prompts and configurations.
*   `scripts/`: Utility scripts (e.g., data preprocessing, deployment).

## 📋 Next Steps
*   Define specific AI/ML tasks and objectives.
*   Gather and preprocess initial datasets.
*   Experiment with different model architectures.
*   Integrate with Ollama for local model serving.
