## ✨ Overview

The **AI Lab Guidelines Integration** ensures that every project generated within the AI Lab Framework adheres to a consistent set of coding standards, best practices, and quality assurance measures. These guidelines are automatically embedded into new projects, providing a solid foundation for maintainable, scalable, and high-quality AI applications.

---

## 📁 Structure

The guidelines are organized into logical categories to cover all aspects of project development:

```
guidelines/
├── 📚 core/                   # Core AI Lab guidelines applicable to all projects
│   ├── coding-standards.md     # Standardized coding conventions and style guides
│   ├── project-structure.md    # Recommended project directory layouts
│   ├── documentation.md        # Best practices for project documentation
│   └── security.md             # Essential security considerations and practices
├── 📄 templates/              # Template-specific guidelines for different project types
│   ├── web-app.md              # Guidelines tailored for web application projects
│   ├── api-service.md          # Guidelines for API service development
│   ├── agent-skill.md          # Guidelines for Agent-OS compatible skills
│   ├── data-pipeline.md        # Guidelines for data processing pipelines
│   └── microservice.md         # Guidelines for microservice architectures
├── ✅ checklists/             # Development checklists for various stages

└── 🤖 automation/             # Automated enforcement mechanisms
    ├── pre-commit-hooks.sh     # Scripts for pre-commit hook installation
    ├── github-actions.yml      # GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
    └── validation-scripts.py   # Python scripts for automated validation
```

## 🤝 Integration Points

These guidelines are seamlessly integrated into various stages of the development lifecycle:

### 1. Project Generation
*   **Automatic Inclusion**: Guidelines are automatically copied and configured into every new project generated by the AI Lab Project Generator.
*   **Template-Specific Rules**: Rules and best practices are tailored and applied based on the chosen project template type.
*   **Default Enforcement**: AI Lab standards are enforced by default, ensuring immediate compliance.

### 2. Development Workflow
*   **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated checks are integrated into pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and standard adherence before commits.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated checks are performed within the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to maintain quality throughout development.
*   **Documentation Templates**: Standardized documentation templates promote consistency across all project documentation.

### 3. Quality Assurance
*   **Automated Code Quality Checks**: Tools like Black, Ruff, and MyPy are pre-configured for automated code quality analysis.
*   **Security Scanning Integration**: Integration with security scanning tools helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities early.
*   **Performance Monitoring Setup**: Basic setups for performance monitoring are included to track and optimize application performance.

## ⬇️ Usage

While guidelines are automatically integrated during project generation, you can also apply or update them in existing projects:

```bash
# Apply AI Lab guidelines to an existing project
./apply-guidelines.sh [project-path]
```
*(Note: The `apply-guidelines.sh` script is a placeholder for a tool that would apply these guidelines to an existing project. Its implementation would depend on the specific needs and tools of the framework.)*

---

## ⚙️ Customization

Guidelines can be customized to fit specific project needs while maintaining the core AI Lab standards. This is typically done via a configuration file within your project:

```yaml
# Example: .ai-lab/guidelines-config.yml
guidelines:
  core_version: "1.0" # Version of the core guidelines being used
  custom_rules:       # Add project-specific rules or exceptions
    - "team-specific-rule-1"
    - "project-specific-rule-2"
  overrides:          # Override default guideline values
    max_line_length: 100  # Example: Override default Black line length from 88 to 100
```
