# {{ project_name }} - Hybrid Architecture Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is a hybrid architecture project focused on `{{ description }}`. It integrates multiple systems and technologies (e.g., AgentOS, n8n, MCP) to create a cohesive and automated ecosystem.

## 융 Hybrid Architecture Stack
*   **Agent Orchestration**: AgentOS
*   **Workflow Automation**: n8n
*   **Runtime Control**: MCP (Multi-Component Platform)
*   **Core Language**: Python

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Setup Environment**:
    *   Ensure AgentOS, n8n, and MCP instances are running and accessible.
    *   Configure API keys and connection details in `.env`.
2.  **AgentOS Configuration**:
    *   Review and customize `agentos/agent.yaml`.
    *   Develop custom tools for AgentOS in `agentos/tools/`.
3.  **n8n Workflow Development**:
    *   Import and configure workflows from `n8n/workflows/`.
    *   Ensure n8n is connected to relevant services.
4.  **MCP Integration**:
    *   Configure MCP modules in `mcp/config.yaml`.
    *   Develop custom MCP components in `mcp/components/`.

## 📁 Project Structure
*   `agentos/`: AgentOS configurations, tools, and context.
*   `n8n/`: n8n workflow definitions and related files.
*   `mcp/`: MCP configurations and custom components.
*   `src/`: Core logic and shared libraries for the hybrid architecture.
*   `docs/`: Architecture diagrams, integration guides, and documentation.
*   `scripts/`: Automation scripts for deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.

## 📋 Next Steps
*   Define the overall hybrid architecture and data flow.
*   Configure initial AgentOS agents and their capabilities.
*   Develop core n8n workflows for automation tasks.
*   Integrate MCP for runtime control and system interactions.
