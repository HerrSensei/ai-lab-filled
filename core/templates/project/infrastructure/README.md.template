# {{ project_name }} - Infrastructure Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is an infrastructure project focused on `{{ description }}`. It aims to define, deploy, and manage the underlying systems and services.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Stack
*   **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (k3s)
*   **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: Terraform
*   **Cloud Provider**: (Specify if applicable, e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, or On-Premise)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Setup Environment**:
    *   Ensure `kubectl`, `terraform`, and `k3s` (if local) are installed and configured.
2.  **k3s Cluster Management**:
    *   To start/stop k3s: `sudo systemctl (start|stop) k3s`
    *   To check cluster status: `kubectl get nodes`
3.  **Terraform Deployment**:
    *   Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
    *   Plan changes: `terraform plan`
    *   Apply changes: `terraform apply`

## 📁 Project Structure
*   `k3s/`: Kubernetes manifests and configurations for k3s.
*   `terraform/`: Terraform configurations for infrastructure provisioning.
*   `ansible/`: Ansible playbooks for configuration management (if used).
*   `docs/`: Infrastructure documentation, diagrams, and runbooks.
*   `scripts/`: Automation scripts for deployment, backup, and maintenance.

## 📋 Next Steps
*   Define specific infrastructure requirements and architecture.
*   Implement initial Terraform configurations for core resources.
*   Deploy and configure k3s cluster.
*   Set up monitoring and logging for infrastructure components.
