# FRM-002-1.5: Documentation Consolidation Strategy

## Overview

Based on the analysis of the documentation in sub-tasks FRM-002-1.1 to FRM-002-1.4, this document outlines a comprehensive strategy to eliminate redundancy, establish clear Single Sources of Truth (SSoT), and improve the overall documentation structure of the AI Lab Framework.

## Part 1: Establish Clear SSoT and Remove Redundancies

### 1.1. `GETTING_STARTED.md` as the SSoT for Setup
- **Action:** Remove the "Getting Started" sections from `README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, and `AI_GUIDE.md`.
- **Action:** Replace the removed sections with a direct link to the root `GETTING_STARTED.md`.
- **SSoT:** `GETTING_STARTED.md` (root).

### 1.2. Consolidate AI Agent Documentation (Revised)
- **Action:** Modify `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` to contain only a clear instruction to refer to `AI_GUIDE.md` for all important information and instructions. These files are regenerated by external tools and should not be deleted.
- **SSoT:** `AI_GUIDE.md` (root).

### 1.3. Consolidate General Development Documentation
- **Action:** Merge the content of `SCRIPT_ORGANIZATION.md` into `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` under a "Repository Structure" or "Development Workflow" section.
- **Action:** After merging, delete `SCRIPT_ORGANIZATION.md`.
- **SSoT:** `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (root).

### 1.4. Consolidate Project-Level Documentation (Postponed)
- **Action:** The consolidation of `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` into `README.md` within project directories is postponed. This will be addressed in a later phase, as the user wishes to ignore project-specific documentation for now.
- **SSoT:** `README.md` (within each project, to be addressed later).

### 1.5. Consolidate `core` Documentation
- **Action:** Merge the structural information from `core/MANUAL.md` into `core/docs/FRAMEWORK_STRUCTURE.md`.
- **Action:** Refactor `core/MANUAL.md` to be a high-level manual for using the core components, with links to the detailed documentation in `core/docs/` and `core/guidelines/`.
- **SSoT:** `core/docs/FRAMEWORK_STRUCTURE.md` for structure, `core/guidelines/GUIDELINES.md` for guidelines.

## Part 2: Address the `docs/` Directory Duplication

The `docs/` directory for the MkDocs site is a major source of redundancy. The following strategy will address this:

### 2.1. Implement a "Sync-to-Docs" Script
- **Action:** Create a script (e.g., `bin/sync-docs.sh`) that copies the SSoT documentation files from their authoritative locations (root, `core/docs/`, `core/guidelines/`) into the `docs/content/` directory before building the MkDocs site.
- **Action:** This script will be the single point of control for what content is included in the public documentation.
- **Action:** The `mkdocs.yml` will only reference files within `docs/content/`, which are now considered build artifacts, not source files.

### 2.2. Clean up the `docs/content/` Directory
- **Action:** Delete all markdown files in `docs/content/` that are duplicates of SSoT documents. This includes the duplicated `GETTING_STARTED.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `AI_GUIDE.md`, `FRAMEWORK_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_MATRIX.md`, and the outdated project management files.
- **Action:** The `sync-docs.sh` script will be responsible for populating this directory with the latest versions from the SSoT locations.

## Part 3: Archive and Deprecate

### 3.1. Archive Outdated Project Management Files
- **Action:** Move the outdated markdown work items from `docs/content/project-management/work-items/` to the `archive/work-items/` directory.
- **Action:** Delete the `docs/content/project-management/project-status.md` file.

### 3.2. Handle `BACKUP_README.md`
- **Action:** Create a new document `core/docs/OPERATIONS.md` and move the general backup strategy from `BACKUP_README.md` into it.
- **Action:** Archive the `BACKUP_README.md` file to `archive/` as it represents a snapshot in time.

## Summary of Proposed Actions (Revised)

- **Merge & Delete:**
    - `SCRIPT_ORGANIZATION.md` -> `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (then delete)
    - `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` -> `README.md` (in each project, **postponed**)
- **Update & Link:**
    - `README.md` (root) -> link to `GETTING_STARTED.md`
    - `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` -> link to `GETTING_STARTED.md`
    - `AI_GUIDE.md` -> link to `GETTING_STARTED.md`
    - `AGENTS.md` -> Update to refer to `AI_GUIDE.md`
    - `GEMINI.md` -> Update to refer to `AI_GUIDE.md`
    - `core/MANUAL.md` -> refactor and link to SSoT docs
- **Sync & Clean `docs/`:**
    - Create `bin/sync-docs.sh` script.
    - Delete duplicated files in `docs/content/`.
    - Update `mkdocs.yml` to work with the synced files.
- **Archive:**
    - `docs/content/project-management/work-items/*.md` -> `archive/work-items/`
    - `BACKUP_README.md` -> `archive/`

This strategy will result in a much cleaner, more maintainable, and less redundant documentation structure, fully adhering to the "Single Source of Truth" principle.
